# FineViP
**FineViP** is a **Fine**-grained, multi-label **Vi**sual **P**rivacy dataset designed to support research on visual privacy protection. 

You can also download the dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19aAviYJdiVtoKSAjssYNr-qu8TmIFgAJ?usp=drive_link).

## Images
The images in this dataset are collected from existing privacy datasets [1-3], as well as public sources such as Flickr, Instagram, and Bing Search Engine, to ensure diversity and comprehensive coverage of privacy categories.

Note: For ethical reasons, we only provide download links to ensure that image owners retain control over their content. The original dataset contains 24,783 images. Due to some expired links, this release includes URLs for the 17,670 images that remain accessible. Researchers who require access to the full dataset may contact me for further information.



## Labels
The dataset includes one public category and 22 fine-grained privacy categories with varying risk levels, as detailed in the following table. These categories are derived from a large-scale cross-cultural privacy survey, aiming to build a taxonomy that reflects real-world user privacy concerns.
